# p5 for 50+ teaching

# Summary

Reaching out to 50 and more p5 educators around the world, "p5 for 50+ teaching" aims to contribute in documenting, showcasing, and sharing teaching experiences, specifically by re-using the existing features of p5js.org. 

**View the p5.js /teach page [here](https://p5js.org/teach) to see the wide variety of work created by the p5.js community. View the /teach repository [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/tree/teach). **

# Background & Goal

 “p5 for 50+ teaching” stems from, and is an extension to my collaborative Processing Foundation Fellowship project "p5 for 50+"" (collaborator: Seonghyeon Kim) for which I research on learning & teaching methods for p5 workshops.

 The main purpose of “p5 for 50+ teaching” was to address the need of collecting and archiving the p5 workshop/class or relevant teaching resources on p5js.org; since they had been scattered across the Web and required extra efforts to access. By creating a seperate /teach page, I hoped to contribute in connecting and consolidating the p5 educator and learner community around the world.

 Still, I activating and fully utilizing the “teaching”s as direct links to a page showcasing the topic, without overloading the website with too much additional features.


Last year, the first [p5.js showcase](https://p5js.org/showcase/) was made, showcasing a gallery of six pieces spanning a variety of categories. The limitation was mostly due to the code used in the p5.js showcase, which consisted of handlebars files. Because of how YAML and handlebars interacted with each other, each showcase details page had to be hardcoded in, which took a lot of time. The need for a new website is detailed in this [issue.](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/819)

In order to increase the showcase to 60 entries without hardcoding everything I created a new standalone website using React and mapped the text content from a JSON file. This meant that each showcase entry and its corresponding detailed page was auto-generated and was not hardcoded like the previous showcase iteration. More details are written below.

# Process

## UI/UX design & prototypes:

- structure
: filter bars
: modal box
- not to overload the entire repository with extra HandleBars, JavaScript, and image <fieldset></fieldset>
- UI and interaction design in line with other pages of p5js.org 
- user experience
- intuitive understanding of information on modal box
- 
- visual accessibility

## Initial gathering of submissions:

- Identified potential 60+ creators to feature; created a database of their p5.js and Processing projects using Airtable; recognized various categories for how p5.js is used
- Established a process for nominating p5.js projects by designing a [Nomination Form](https://forms.gle/tukmUDqzLUwckjAVA) with appropriate questions
- Reached out to the creators of 9 projects based on how they used p5.js to explore interesting concepts and contexts for art and design, with other technologies, and/or various learning/teaching methodologies; received interviews about 6 projects



- Created [documentation](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/blob/main/contributor_docs/showcase_documentation.md) for the old p5.js 2019 showcase and how to add to it ([PR here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/796/files))
- Created [minor UI improvements](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/813) to the old p5.js 2019 showcase (created tool tags for each project using handlebars). View all PR's for the p5js-website [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aconnieliu0+).
- For the 2020 showcase, created various marketing materials ([view Figma here](https://www.figma.com/file/Ym32EUY2S3z9DCTahMgpRc/Figma-Showcase?node-id=436%3A80) and [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Ym32EUY2S3z9DCTahMgpRc/Figma-Showcase?node-id=45%3A14)), and recreated the nomination form questions for easier integration of CSV content from autogenerated google form sheet data into a JSON format. [View the 2020 form here.](https://forms.gle/s2YNLT5eRdQLCKAm6)
- Reviewed all form submissions to see which ones to add to the showcase and lightly edited 60 final showcase entries for clarity.
- Created various mockups for how the final p5.js showcase would look as well as potential data visualizations of form responses to demonstrate the diversity of the p5.js community with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Ym32EUY2S3z9DCTahMgpRc/Figma-Showcase?node-id=127%3A0). Lightly user-tested these designs w/ mentors and others to make sure they were understandable.

## Implementation

***(view repository [here](https://github.com/connieliu0/p5.js-showcase), view live version of the showcase [here](https://showcase.p5js.org/#/)):***

- Created a main `/teach` page on p5js.org via a [“teach” branch](https://github.com/kangashley/p5.js-website/tree/showcase) in a fork of p5.js-website repo  `/showcase/featuring`

- Filters for various project categories. Hand-classified projects to relevant categories.

- Migrated 2019 showcase content to the new website for preservation and included link to reference the original 2019 showcase page.
- Created [documentation](https://github.com/connieliu0/p5.js-showcase/blob/master/showcase2020_documentation.md) on how to add translations to the new showcase as well as a general overview of how i18next works in tandem with React and how to convert form results to the JSON format for adding entries.
- For the [final pull request](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/851), updated links to the new p5.js 2020 showcase as entry points for the new website.
- Initiated a [code review](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/488) of implementations based on accessibility recommendations from the p5.js Website Audit, done at the p5.js Contributors’ Conference

# Future Plan  & Sustainability

Further Contributions
- add Korean translation
- add alt text to photo images
- submission

Future contributors
- add Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi translation
- gather more experiences from around the world!
- link with the newly /showcase page

  
I hope that the showcase can be expanded every year or two years as a celebration of people's work. I truly believe it's a unique opportunity to bring the p5.js community together to celebrate everyone's work.

# Acknowledgements

I feel like I have spent a substantial amount of time for Processing Foundation and p5.js. I hope to share the opportunities I was shared by the community with people around me, 

I feel like have spent I feel so grateful  I am so grateful to the Processing Foundation for providing me with this opportunity to expand and curate a new p5.js showcase. This summer's project was the perfect blend of everything I loved- community engagement, design, and the creative implementation of technology. In fact, it was p5.js that inspired me to pursue coding at the university level. Seeing the community's creative projects and sketches as a high school junior made me fall in love with the world of creative computing.

However, what really made this summer's GSoC experience with p5.js and the Processing Foundation especially special was the community itself. First and foremost I'd like to thank my wonderful and inspiring mentors Joey Lee and Yining Shi! They helped me so much with  everything- from the best way to approach a bug to the actual curation of the showcase. In addition, they imparted so much wisdom in regards to a career in creative tech and provided advice on how to approach problems as a novice coder. I'd also like to thank my fellow GSoC-er, Inhwa Yeom, who was working on a similar project for her advice and support. In addition I'd like to thank Nick McIntyre and Kate Hollenbach for their feedback on my proposal, as well as Saber Khan, Aarón Montoya-Moraga, Ashley Kang and the various contributors and maintainers of p5.js for their help. Finally, I'd like to thank Lauren McCarthy and Moira Turner for leading the p5.js project itself.

All in all, this project has provided me with a wonderful first experience in contributing to open source and I'm forever grateful. I can't wait to see where p5.js takes off to next.
